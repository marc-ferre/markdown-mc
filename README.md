- Illumina.
- Ion Torrent.

* Nanopore.
* Sanger (by terminators).
```

### Syntax Highlighting

The extension provides syntax highlighting that works with any VS Code theme:

- **QCM Identifiers** `## [id]` - highlighted as headings with special brackets
- **Questions** `### Question` - highlighted as section headings
- **Correct Answers** `+ Answer` - highlighted as inserted text (usually green)
- **Incorrect Answers** `- Answer` - highlighted as deleted text (usually red)### Available Snippets

- `qcmh`: QCM header only
- `quest`: Question only
- `+`: Correct answer
- `-`: Incorrect answer
- `qcm+`: QCM with multiple correct answers
